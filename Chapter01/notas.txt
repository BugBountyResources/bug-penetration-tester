The snippet in question is a pretty simple test â€“ it executes an
alert() function within an improperly sanitized src attribute
attached to an <img> HTML tag:

<IMG SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')>

it's good to remember to output some info about where the XSS is
happening (for example, alert(window.location.href)).
