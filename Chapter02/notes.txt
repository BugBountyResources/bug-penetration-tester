Chapter 2. Choosing Your Hunting Ground

Bugcrowd (https://www.bugcrowd.com/) has a standard sign-up
process and doesn't require any proof of experience to become a
researcher. You can choose to make your profile public (so people
can see the kudos points you've accumulated and general stats
about your involvement) or keep it private.

HackerOne (https://www.hackerone.com/) is a similar platform – it
has its own point system (reputation) and also calculates a
variety of metrics that it uses as the basis for its Leaderboard
and for invitations to its own private programs.

Finding Other Programs

Many companies have bug bounty programs. If there's a particular
site or app you're interested in testing, finding out whether it's
supported by a bug bounty is as easy as a couple of searches.
Queries that take advantage of Google's expressive search syntax,
such as inurl:/security/, intext:bug bounty, and intext:reward are
all great building blocks you can use to discover new programs.
You can even combine them to drill down into bounty programs that
are specific to a certain application – a query such as
intext:"Bug Bounty" AND intext:"vulnerability" AND intext:"reward"
AND inurl:"/wp-content/"  can be used to return program pages for
Wordpress sites (credit to Sachin Wagh (@tiger_tigerboy) for the
dorks).

The attack surface of a software environment is the sum of the
    different points (the attack vectors) where an unauthorized
    user (the attacker) can try to enter data to or extract data
    from an environment.
