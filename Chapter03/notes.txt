Relative Attack Surface Quotient (RASQ)

    The Attack Surface of an application is, put succinctly,
    wherever data can enter or exit the app. Attack-surface
    analysis describes the methods used to describe the vulnerable
    parts of an application

Scanning and Target Reconaissance




Brute-forcing Web Content

    Fuzzing tools such as wfuzz can be used to discover web
    content by trying different paths, with URIs taken from giant
    wordlists

    clone the SecLists GitHub repository (a curated collection of
    fuzz lists, SQLi injection scripts, XSS snippets, and other
    generally malicious input) at https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists. We can start a scan of the target
    site simply be replacing the part of the URL we'd like to
    replace with the wordlist with the FUZZ string:

    wfuzz -w ~/Code/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/SVNDigger/all.txt --hc 404 http://webscantest.com/FUZZ

    @@@@@@@@@@@@@
        Keep in mind that brute-forcers are very noisy. Only use them against isolated staging/QA environments, and only with permission. If your brute-forcer overwhelms a production server, it's really no different from a DoS attack.

        ejemplo :
        wfuzz -w ~/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/SVNDigger/all.txt --hc 404 http://webscantest.com/FUZZ



Kali Linux (Tool Page)
    apt -y install seclists



Burp Spider

    To kick-off a spidering session, make sure you have the appropriate domains in scope:

    You can then right-click the target domain and select Spider this host:


Striker

    Striker (https://github.com/s0md3v/Striker) is a Python-
    offensive information and vulnerability scanner that does a
    number of checks using different sources, but has a particular
    focus on DNS and network information. You can install it by
    following the instructions on its Github page. Like many
    Python projects, it simply requires cloning the code and
    downloading the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
