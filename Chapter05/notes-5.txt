Chapter 5. SQL, Code Injection, and Scanners

Then you can create a symlink (symbolic link) so that all the arachni CLI packages will be available within your path (fill in the correct path to your arachni installation):

sudo ln -s /Path/to/arachni-1.5.1-0.5.12/bin/arachni* /usr/local/bin

You might find that, after you symlink your arachni executables to your path, you receive the following error:

/usr/local/bin/arachni: line 3: /usr/local/bin/readlink_f.sh: No such file or directory
/usr/local/bin/arachni: line 4: readlink_f: command not found
/usr/local/bin/arachni: line 4: ./../system/setenv: No such file or directory

If you receive this error, simply symlink, copy, or move the readlink_f.sh script from your arachni installation's bin directory to your own path. In this case, we'll symlink it:

sudo ln -s /Path/to/arachni-1.5.1-0.5.12/bin/readlink_f.sh /usr/local/bin/readline_f.sh



Now when we use arachni later in the chapter, we can invoke it directly, as opposed to having to type the full path each time.
