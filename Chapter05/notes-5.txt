Chapter 5. SQL, Code Injection, and Scanners

Then you can create a symlink (symbolic link) so that all the arachni CLI packages will be available within your path (fill in the correct path to your arachni installation):

sudo ln -s /Path/to/arachni-1.5.1-0.5.12/bin/arachni* /usr/local/bin

You might find that, after you symlink your arachni executables to your path, you receive the following error:

/usr/local/bin/arachni: line 3: /usr/local/bin/readlink_f.sh: No such file or directory
/usr/local/bin/arachni: line 4: readlink_f: command not found
/usr/local/bin/arachni: line 4: ./../system/setenv: No such file or directory

If you receive this error, simply symlink, copy, or move the readlink_f.sh script from your arachni installation's bin directory to your own path. In this case, we'll symlink it:

sudo ln -s /Path/to/arachni-1.5.1-0.5.12/bin/readlink_f.sh /usr/local/bin/readline_f.sh



Now when we use arachni later in the chapter, we can invoke it directly, as opposed to having to type the full path each time.

Google Dorks for SQLi
            https://www.exploit-db.com/

    Here are a few examples of common Google Dorks for discovering instances of SQLi:

    inurl:index.php?id=
    inurl:buy.php?category=
    inurl:pageid=
    inurl:page.php?file=

We'll also be using Arachni as our go-to scanner. Though noisy,
scanners can be indispensable for the appropriate situation, and
are great at flushing out otherwise hard-to-detect bugs. Arachni
is an excellent choice because it's open source, multi-threaded,
extensible via plugins, and has a great CLI that allows it to be
worked into other automated workflows

SQLi and other code injection attacks - Accepting
    Unvalidated Data

SELECT title, author FROM posts WHERE id=$id

$id =
    value is being inserted directly—with no data sanitization,
    removal of dangerous code, or data type transformation—the
    SQL statement is dynamic, and subject to tampering


SELECT title, author FROM posts WHERE id=10 OR 1=1

10 or 1=1 is the user-supplied data . By modifying the
WHERE clause ,
    the example is innocuous (inocuo) ,but if the statement
    asked for account information from user table , or
    a part of the database associated with privileges ,
    instead (en lugar de) of just information about a blog
    post , that could represent a way to seriosly demage
    the aplication

    Testing for SQLi with sqlmap Where to find it and
    how to verify it


    sqlmap -u "http://webscantest.com/datastore/search_get_by_id.php?id=3"

    -u = url target


it looks like the back-end DBMS is 'MySQL'. Do you want to skip test payloads specific for other DBMSes? [Y/n]

    parece que el DBMS de fondo es 'MySQL'. ¿Desea omitir cargas de prueba específicas para otros DBMS? [S / n]


If you can successfully identify the backend through your own
investigations, it's a good idea to say yes here,
    just to reduce any posssible noise in the report

you should also get a question about what risk level of
input values you're willing to tolerate:

    for the remaining tests, do you want to include all tests for 'MySQL' extending provided level (1) and risk (1) values?


be carrefull with noise and damange any data
    Because of the sensitivity of the information and processes contained in the targeted SQL database, it's important to tread carefully with vulnerabilities associated with backend systems.


for the previous example id=3 is vulnerable. Do you want
    keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N]  y


Success! There are a few vulnerabilities related to the id parameter, including a pair of blind SQLi vulnerabilities (where the results of the injection are not directly visible in the GUI) and error- and UNION-based inputs—all confirmed by the documentation on webscantest.com

    Trawling for Bugs - Using Google Dorks and Python
    for SQLi Discovery


Google Dorks for SQLi
    means employing specially-crafted (especialmente disenado)
    search queries to get search engines to return sites
    susceptible to SQLi and others vulnerabilities

    inurl:index.php?id=
    inurl:buy.php?category=
    inurl:pageid=
    inurl:page.php?file=

the basic form
    search_method:domain/dork
        intitle:”EvoCam” inurl:”webcam.html”

    This dork doesn't target a particular URL; it's simply
    looking for any site where the page's title contains Evocam
    and the page's URL contains webcam.html.


Validating a Dork
    while brwosing a small security site, I find the following
    dork, list on the company's Bugtrag section
    (the title of the company featured un the intex field
    has been changed):

    inurl:index.jsp? intext:"some company title"

this dork though it doesn't have a target URL , does focus
on a particular company via the "index" search filter.
Fot the "inurl" value , "jps" is the extention for 'JPS'
a web application framework for java servlets.
jps is a little old-it was Sun Microsystems' response
to Microsoft's 'Active Server Page(ASP)' in 1999-but
like so much tech , is still employed in legacy industries
, small business and small "dev" shops.


When we use this dork to search Google, our first result returns a URL containing index.jsp?:

    http://www.examplesite.com/index.jsp?idPagina=12

        JPS (Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool) is a command is used to check all the Hadoop daemons like NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, NodeManager etc. which are running on the machine

We can see the site is making a GET request , passing a parameter
identifying the page visited (idPagina). Let's check that and see
if it's vulnerable, which we can do by passing the URL to sqlmap

sqlmap -u "http://www.examplesite.com/index.jsp?idPagina=12"

sqlmap is valid command options Dorks , '-g', making it also
posssible to pass a string of the dork you'd like to search
(instead of doing the search manually )

    sqlmap -g 'inurl:index.jsp? intext:"some company title"'

        https://www.exploit-db.com/

@@@@@@@@        Time-based SQLi

    Is when SLEEP() or another similar function is called to
inject a delay into to query being processed.

This is combined with conditionals and other logic, is
then used to extract information from database by slowly
enumerating resources.

if your payload produces a delay a delay , you can infer
your condition evaluated to 'TRUE' and the assumptions
you made are correct.

doing this enough can expose sensitive information to
determined attackers.

As an attack, time-based SQLi is very noise . the impact
on application logs is relatuvely small, but repeated use
of time-based SQLi will cause large CPU consumption spikes,
easily detectable by an attentive sysadmin or SRE

If we take the payload from the sqlmap time-based results (12 RLIKE SLEEP(5)) and plug it into the idPagina URL parameter, we find it's successful! The page takes longer to load as our SLEEP(5) command is not sanitized and gets mistakenly executed by the application's SQL server. This is a bona fide bug.

        Scannig for SQLi with arachni

Arachni es our weapon of choice for SQLi sacnners because
it's open source, extensible, multi-threaded, and can be
used from a CLI that plays nicely with other form of automation.

--timeout
        The --timeout parameter allows you to pass as an argument to
        specify how long arachni should wait before shutting down
        and compiling a report based on the collected data.

--checks
        By default, when you target a URL, without passing any extra
        information, you'll be applying every check arachni has in
        its system

        But sometimes you might want to exclude some lower-priority
        warnings—arachni, for example, will warn you when a company
        email is exposed publicly, but usually that's not an issue
        if the email is a corporate handle or meant to otherwise be
        customer-facing. Some forms of data leakage are important,
        but for most companies this is not one of them. You also
        might want to exclude noisy checks that would put too much
        of a load on the target server or network architecture.

        The checks option takes as its arguments the checks you
        should include and exclude, with the splat character *
        operating as its usual stand-in for all options and excluded
        checks indicated by the use of a minus sign (-).


--scope-include-subdomains
        This switch does just what it sounds like—it tells arachni
        that, when it spiders a URL, it's free to follow any links
        it finds to that site's subdomains.


--plugin 'PLUGIN:OPTION=VALUE,OPTION2=VALUE2'
        The plugin option allows us to pass environment variables
        that an arachni plugin might depend on (authentication
        tokens for SaaS variables, configuration settings, SMTP
        usernames and passwords, and so on).


--http-request-concurrency MAX_CONCURRENCY
        Arachni's ability to keep its HTTP requests in check is
        critical to ensuring a target server isn't overwhelmed with
        traffic. Even if scans are allowed under the terms of
        engagement for a specific target range, they'll typically
        set a speed limit for the scanner to prevent the equivalent
        of a DoS attack. And regardless, turning your request
        concurrency down can ensure you don't get hit by a WAF. The
        default for the scanner's MAX_CONCURRENCY is 20 HTTP
        requests/second.


Writing a Wrapper Script
    just as we wrote our bootstrap_burp.sh
    Script as convenient wrapper around the longer command
    initializing Burp's JAR file.
    son that we don't have to type full path and all our
    options each time we start the application, we can do
    the same fot arachni
    Putting together all of the options we've just covered
    (except fot --plugins ), this is what our script looks
    like. We'll call it "ascan.sh"

    #!/bin/sh

    arachni $1 \
        --checks=*,-emails* \
        --scope-include-subdomains \
        --timeout 0:05:00 \
        --http-request-concurrency 10


    Like bootstrap_burp.sh we  can make it executables through a
    simple chmod u+x ascan.sh and add it into pou path by
    using
        sudo ln -s /path/to/ascan.sh  /usr/local/bin/ascan

    The timeout admittedly long, to accommodate the longer
    that occur with a smaller request pool, as well as the extended
    waiting necesary because of time-based SQLi calls .

        NoSQL injection - injecting Malformed MongoDB Queries

According to OWASP, there are over 150 varieties of NoSQL database
available for use in web application.

We're going to take a look specifically at MongoDB, the most
widely-used open-source , unstructured NoSQL database to
illustrate can work across a variety of toolset

The MongoDB API usually expects BSON data (binary JSON)
construted using a secure BSON query constrution.
But in certain cases, MongoDB can also unserialized JSON
and JavaScript expressions-like in the case of the
$where operator . It's usually used-like SQL "WHERE"
operator-as a filter .


    db.myCollection.find( { $where: "this.foo == this.baz" } );
